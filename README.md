| 3 | [Megaline Plan Study](https://github.com/Barrett34/Megaline-Telecom-Plan-Study) | In this statistical data analysis project for telecom operator Megaline, we will determine which prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, brings in more revenue to determine their budget for their advertising team. | Statistical Data Analysis, Probability Theory, Testing Hypothesis
| 4 | [Vehicle Data Analysis](https://github.com/Barrett34/Vehicle-Data-Analysis-) | This project compares the statistical data of US vehicles that are on sale. | Intermediate Python
| 5 | [Ice Video Game E-Commerce Success Study](https://github.com/Barrett34/Ice-Video-Game-E-Commerce) | Identify patterns that determine whether or not a video game will succeed or not. Dataset from video game store Ice. | Seaborn for Visualizations
| 6 | [Zuber Ride Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/Barrett34/Zuber_Ridesharing_Analysis) | Our goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We will also analyze the data from competitors and test the hypothesis that weather impacts ride frequency. | SQL, PySpark
| 7 | [Megaline Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/Barrett34/ML_Model_Megaline) | Develop a model that picks the correct plan for Megaline's legacy customers. | Machine Learning, Regression, Model Improvements
| 8 | [Beta Bank Customers Retention](https://github.com/Barrett34/Beta_Bank_Customer_Retention) | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.  | Supervised Learning, Classification Metrics, Imbalanced Classification, Regression Metrics, Feature Preparation
| 9 | [OilyGiant Highest Profit Prediction](https://github.com/Barrett34/OilyGiant-Highest-Profit-Prediciton) | Find the best new place for OilyGiant to create a new oil well by creating a model for predicting the volume reserves in the new well. | Business Metrics, Data Collection, Bootstrapping
| 10 | [Zyfra Gold Ore ML Model Gold Recovery Prediciton](https://github.com/Barrett34/Zyfra-Gold-Ore-ML-Model-Gold-Recovery-Prediction) | Zyfra is a gold ore company that is in need of a machine learning model to predict how much gold can be recovered from a gold ore. | *Integrated Project*
| 11 | [Sure Tomorrow Insurance Customer Benefit Prediction](https://github.com/Barrett34/Sure_Tomorrow_Insurance_Benefits_Predictions) | The Sure Tomorrow company needs a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. | Linear Algebra, Matrices & Matrix Operations, Vectors & Vector Operations
| 12 | [Rusty Bargain Car Value Model](https://github.com/Barrett34/Rusty-Bargain-Car-Value-Model) | Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. We need to build the model to determine the value. | Numerical Methods, Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting
| 13 | [Sweet Lift Taxi Order Prediciton](https://github.com/Barrett34/Sweet_Lift_Taxi_Order_Prediciton) | To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction. | Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
| 14 | [Film Junky Union Negative Review Model](https://github.com/Barrett34/Film_Junky_Union_Negative_Review_Model) | The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. | Machine Learning for Texts, Text Vectorization, Language Representations
| 15 | [Computer Vision Age Detection Model](https://github.com/Barrett34/Age_Detection_Computer_Vision) | The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. We will build a model with the ImageDataGenerator and a GPU Platform to train the model. | Computer Vision, Fully Connected networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
| 16 | [Interconnect Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/Barrett34/Final_Project_Interconnect_Telecom_Churn) | The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. We will build a model with the ImageDataGenerator and a GPU Platform to train the model. | *Final Project*
